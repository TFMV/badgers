# Roadmap

This document outlines the architectural vision and implementation roadmap for bringing Badgers into feature parity with Polars, a high-performance DataFrame library. The goal is to create a robust, type-safe, and efficient DataFrame implementation in Go that leverages Arrow's memory model.

## Vision

Badgers aims to be the Go equivalent of Polars - a DataFrame library that is:

1. **High-performance**: Optimized for efficient data processing
2. **Memory-efficient**: Leveraging Arrow's memory model
3. **Type-safe**: Using Go generics for compile-time type checking
4. **User-friendly**: Intuitive API design
5. **Scalable**: Handling datasets of any size through chunking and streaming
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new data types and operations

## Current Architecture

Badgers is built on three primary components:

1. **chunked**: Generic implementation of chunked arrays
2. **series**: Type-safe series implementation
3. **frame**: DataFrame implementation
